This script provide insights into calculating heatwave threshold, occurrence and magnitude over some Selected towns in Ghana's sudan and Guinea savannah agro-climatic zones

A STUDY TO FILL AN EMPIRICAL GAP, CONTRIBUTE TO ACHIEVEMENT OF SDG 3, 13 AND 15


CHARACTERISTICS AND LONG TERM TRENDS OF HEATWAVES OVER GHANA(selected some towns in Ghanas' Sudan and Guinea Savannah agro-climatic zones) using outputs from Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 2.6, 8.5) and Ghana Meteorological Agency.
Results indicate the intensification of more heatwave events (2025 - 2054) , with mean magnitudes increasing by 0.5ËšC to 2.5ËšC.
The frequency of heatwave days is projected to rise by 8.1% to 58% annually. 
Our findings suggest a significant intensification of heatwaves in the selected regions, with potential severe impacts on ecosystems and human health. This underscores the urgent need for enhanced planning, early warning systems and adaptive measures! . 
We recommend prioritizing heat-resilient infrastructure and community-based adaptation strategies to safeguard vulnerable populations in Ghana! .
Other papers / reasearch indicate the intensification of heatwav events in the future ðŸ‘€ , Climate Science is funðŸ’Ÿ


A paper on the prevalence and characteristics of heatwaves in Northern Ghana is currently under review
